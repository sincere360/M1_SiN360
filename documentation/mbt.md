# M1 Build Tool

The M1 firmware can be built with STM32CubeIDE or Visual Studio Code.

## Installation  

Clone the repository. Install the required software and extensions:

* For STM32CubeIDE users:

- The code has been built with STM32CubeIDE 1.17.0.
Download: https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html (STM32CubeIDE 1.17.0, GNU Tools for STM32 12.3.rel1),
and https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html.

* For Visual Studio Code users:

- The code has been built with arm-none-eabi-gcc 14.2.Rel1.
Download: https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads (14.2.Rel1)

* For Linux users:

- Install ARM GCC toolchain (e.g., `arm-none-eabi-gcc`), Ninja, and srecord via yay
- On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi ninja-build srecord`

- VSCode download: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Extensions installation:
+ [CMake Tools](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools)
+ [Cortex-Debug](https://github.com/Marus/cortex-debug)
+ [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) (follow steps below)

- Chocolatey (package manager) installation:
Download: https://sourceforge.net/projects/chocolatey.mirror/

Prerequisites:
Before running the installation command, ensure that you have Chocolatey itself installed. You can find official installation instructions on the Chocolatey website. 

Installation Command:
Open an elevated Command Prompt or PowerShell session (right-click and select "Run as administrator") and execute the following command:

```powershell
choco install ninja
```

Verification:
After the installation is complete, you can verify that Ninja is installed correctly and added to your system's PATH environment variable by opening a new terminal window and running:

```powershell
ninja --version
```

## Build

* For Linux users:
```bash
make
```
Output: `./artifacts/` (MonstaTek_M1_v0800.elf, .bin, .hex)

* For Visual Studio Code users:
- Select build type from PROJECT STATUS - Configure (gcc-14_2_build-release, gcc-14_2_build-debug).
- Click the Build icon.

* For STM32CubeIDE users:
Build in the IDE.

## Build directories

* For Linux users:
Firmware is built in the folder `./build/` with output copied to `./artifacts/`.

* For Visual Studio Code users:
Firmware is built in the folder ./out/build/gcc-14_2_build-release for release configuration and ./out/build/gcc-14_2_build-debug for debug configuration.

* For STM32CubeIDE users:
Firmware is built in the folder ./Release for release configuration and ./Debug for debug configuration.

## SRecord (srec_cat) – download, install, and use for CRC

The **srec_cat** tool from the [SRecord](https://srecord.sourceforge.net/) package is used to append CRC-32 bytes to the firmware binary.

### Download and install

- **Tool:** `srec_cat` (part of SRecord)
- **Download:** https://srecord.sourceforge.net/download.html  
  Get the Windows distribution (e.g. ZIP), extract it, and ensure the directory containing `srec_cat.exe` is on your system **PATH** (e.g. add that directory to the PATH environment variable in Windows so you can run `srec_cat` from any terminal).

### Command-line usage

From a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell), in the directory that contains your built binary:

```text
srec_cat MonstaTek_M1_v0800.bin -binary -crop 0x0 0x000FFC14 -STM32_Little_Endian 0x000FFC14 -o M1_v0800_wcrc.bin -binary
```

Where:

- **MonstaTek_M1_v0800.bin** – Input binary file (e.g. produced by STM32CubeIDE or the VS Code build after a successful build).
- **M1_v0800_wcrc.bin** – Output binary file with CRC-32 bytes appended.
- **0x000FFC14** – Image size of the binary (fixed value for this firmware).

After running the command, use **M1_v0800_wcrc.bin** (or the name you gave with `-o`) as the image with CRC for programming.

---

## Post-build command for CRC

These instructions are only for users with previous source code who want to generate a binary with CRC bytes appended automatically at build time. Ensure SRecord is installed and `srec_cat` is on your PATH (see [SRecord (srec_cat) – download, install, and use for CRC](#srecord-srec_cat--download-install-and-use-for-crc) above).

* STM32CubeIDE users:

  - Make sure you have installed SRecord and added `srec_cat` to your PATH (see above).
  - Go to menu **Project → Properties → C/C++ Build → Settings → Build Steps → Post-build steps – Command**.
  - In the Command box, enter:

    ```text
    srec_cat $(OBJCOPY_BIN) -binary -crop 0x0 0x000FFC14 -STM32_Little_Endian 0x000FFC14 -o $(BUILD_ARTIFACT_NAME)_wCRC.bin -binary
    ```

  - After building the project, an extra binary file `MonstaTek_M1_v0800_wCRC.bin` with CRC bytes appended will be generated.

* VSCode users:

  - Make sure you have installed SRecord and added `srec_cat` to your PATH (see [SRecord (srec_cat) – download, install, and use for CRC](#srecord-srec_cat--download-install-and-use-for-crc) above).
  - Download and update the file `CMakeLists.txt` in the source folder (`<source folder>/CMakeLists.txt`).
  - After building the project, an extra binary file `MonstaTek_M1_v0800_wCRC.bin` with CRC bytes appended will be generated.

## Debug

* For Visual Studio Code users:
- Select debugger from RUN AND DEBUG (Debug with ST-Link, Debug with J-Link).
- Debugger setting can be changed in ./.vscode/launch.json.
- J-Link software download: https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/

* For STM32CubeIDE users:
Debug in the IDE.
