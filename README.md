# M1 SiN360 Firmware

Custom firmware for the Monstatek M1 multi-protocol security research device, built on STM32H5 with an ESP32-C6 wireless coprocessor.

This project started as a fork of the original Monstatek M1 firmware and adds completed feature stubs, a working SD-card update flow, expanded NFC/RFID/IR tools, and a growing WiFi/BLE toolset backed by companion ESP32-C6 firmware.

## Current Release

**SiN360 v0.9.1.0**

This release rolls up the latest WiFi, BLE, NFC, Sub-GHz, LF RFID, BadUSB/BadBLE, and external app work. It pairs with the `v0.9.1.0` ESP32-C6 companion firmware for the current WiFi/BLE command set and deauth fix.

### Branding

- Firmware version: `0.9.1.0`
- Boot screen now uses SiN360 branding with the firmware version underneath
- Boot and main-menu logos updated with custom monochrome artwork
- Generic BLE advertising now defaults to `M1`; BadBLE advertises as `Keyboard-XX`

### ESP32-C6 Companion Firmware

The WiFi and BLE features require compatible ESP32-C6 companion firmware. The STM32 and ESP32 sides communicate over a 64-byte binary SPI protocol, so update the ESP32 side when a release changes WiFi/BLE commands.

Current compatible ESP32 release: `v0.9.1.0`

## Evil Portal Custom HTML

Custom Evil Portal pages are loaded from SD card through the WiFi portal configuration flow. Use `.html` or `.htm` files and keep each page at or below `32768` bytes. Inline CSS and JavaScript work best because captive portal clients may not load external `http` or `https` assets reliably.

Use `{{SSID}}` anywhere in custom HTML to show the active portal SSID. This also works with Karma Portal, so a page can display the current probe-followed SSID instead of a stale configured name.

For the most reliable credential capture, use a normal POST form:

```html
<form method="POST" action="/login">
  <input name="ssid" placeholder="Network name">
  <input name="password" type="password" placeholder="Password">
  <button type="submit">Continue</button>
</form>
```

The portal accepts common username/network field names: `user`, `username`, `email`, `login`, `identity`, `ssid`, `wifi`, `wifi_name`, `network`, and `network_name`. Password fields can be named `pass`, `password`, or `pwd`.

Simple GET forms also work for imported pages, including forms that submit to paths such as `/get`, as long as the fields use the supported names.

Custom pages also get an injected capture helper. It mirrors JavaScript form submissions and `fetch()` POST bodies to `/login`, so pages that call `preventDefault()` can still capture as long as the form fields use the supported names. JSON POST bodies are accepted too, including common `/sendJSON` style pages.

## Status

Still in progress:

- Screenshots and deeper how-to documents
- More BLE detection signatures and payload tuning
- More Evil Portal polish and a dedicated portal authoring document
- Field tuning for advanced raw WiFi management-frame attacks across more chipsets
- Field tuning for advanced Sub-GHz/RFID protocols and NFC range-extender behavior
- More BadUSB/BadBLE script commands, preview, pause, and stop controls
- GPS and other advanced features

## Building STM32 Firmware

### Prerequisites

- ARM GCC toolchain, `arm-none-eabi-gcc` 14.2 or newer
- CMake 3.22+
- Ninja
- Python 3

### Linux Command Line

```bash
make
```

Output:

```text
artifacts/M1_SiN360_v0.9.1.0.bin
```

### VS Code

1. Install the prerequisites above.
2. Install the VS Code **CMake Tools** and **Cortex-Debug** extensions.
3. Open the project folder.
4. Select the release CMake preset.
5. Build from the CMake panel or with the configured build task.

Output is normally:

```text
out/build/gcc-14_2_build-release/M1_SiN360_v0.9.1.0_SD.bin
```

## Building ESP32 Firmware

The ESP32-C6 companion firmware is built with ESP-IDF v5.5.

```bash
cd M1_SiN360_ESP32
. /path/to/esp-idf/export.sh
idf.py build
```

For SD-card ESP32 firmware updates, use a compatible release from the companion ESP32 repository.

Copy the ESP32 update files to the SD card, then use **Settings > ESP32 > Firmware Update** on the M1.

## Flashing STM32 Firmware

### Via SD Card

1. Copy `M1_SiN360_v0.9.1.0_SD.bin` to the M1 SD card.
2. On the M1, open **Settings > Firmware Update**.
3. Select the firmware file.
4. Wait for the update to complete and reboot.

### Via ST-Link

Connect ST-Link V2 to the M1 GPIO header:

- Pin 10, PA14 -> SWCLK
- Pin 11, PA13 -> SWDIO
- Pin 8 or 18 -> GND

```bash
st-flash write M1_SiN360_v0.9.1.0.bin 0x08000000
```

## Dual Firmware Banks

The M1 has two flash banks. SD-card firmware updates write to the inactive bank, which makes it possible to keep two firmware builds installed and switch between them.

SiN360 supports switching from **Settings > Switch Bank**. A safety fallback is available by holding **BACK + DOWN** during power-up to roll back to the other bank.
