# M1 SiN360 Firmware

Custom firmware for the Monstatek M1 multi-protocol security research device, built on STM32H5.

Forked from the original Monstatek M1 firmware (v0.8) with completed feature stubs, new tools, and build system fixes.

## What's New in SiN360 v0.9.0.3

### Completed Features (formerly stubs)
- **USB-UART Bridge** -- Full runtime CDC mode switching with status screen, transparent bridge operation
- **Sub-GHz Radio Settings** -- Configurable frequency band (300-915 MHz), modulation (OOK/ASK/FSK), TX power (4 levels)
- **Sub-GHz Recording** -- Live signal feedback during recording
- **125 kHz RFID Utilities**
  - **Clone Card** -- Quick read-to-write flow for T5577 without saving to SD
  - **Brute Force FC** -- Cycle H10301 facility codes 0-255 with progress bar, pause/resume
- **IR Universal Remote** -- Built-in database with 15 TV brands (Samsung, LG, Sony, Philips, Panasonic, Vizio, TCL/Roku, Hisense, Toshiba, Sharp, Insignia, Sanyo, Magnavox, and 2 generic NEC profiles), 8-14 commands per brand
- **Switch Bank** -- Swap between two firmware banks from Settings menu with confirmation screen, enabling dual-firmware setups with other community developers
- **IR File Loader** -- Load Flipper-compatible .ir files from SD card, browse and transmit any command. Supports NEC, Samsung32, Samsung48, RC5, RC6, SIRCS, Kaseikyo, Denon/Sharp, JVC, BOSE, LG protocols
- **NFC Cyborg Detector** -- Continuous NFC field to illuminate body implant LEDs
- **NFC Mifare Fuzzer** -- Cycles sequential UIDs emulating Mifare Classic 1K to test reader responses
- **NFC Write URL** -- Write custom URLs as NDEF to NTAG tags (NFC business cards)
- **NFC Utils** -- Write UID to magic cards, Wipe T2T tags

### Build System Fixes
- **Fixed CRC generation** -- Replaced broken srec_cat CRC with correct STM32 hardware CRC32 append via Python script
- **SD card updates now work reliably** -- Users with original firmware can update via SD card without CRC failures
- **Clean build output** -- Single firmware binary with correct naming

### Compatibility Fixes
- **SPI handshake race condition fix** -- Prevents deadlock when using third-party ESP32 firmware such as Bad-BT. Backward compatible with stock ESP32 firmware (credit: cd3daddy)

## Dual Firmware Setup

The M1 has two flash banks. You can run a different firmware on each bank and switch between them. No ST-Link required.

### Initial Setup (no ST-Link needed)

1. Start with any working firmware on your M1
2. Put the first custom firmware .bin on the SD card
3. Settings > Firmware Update > select the file > update completes and reboots
4. You are now on Bank 2 with the first custom firmware
5. Put the second custom firmware .bin on the SD card
6. Settings > Firmware Update > select the file > update completes and reboots
7. You are now on Bank 1 with the second custom firmware
8. Both banks now have custom firmware

#### Switching Between Firmwares

Each firmware may have a different way to switch banks. For SiN360:
- **From Settings menu:** Settings > Switch Bank > OK > OK to confirm > device reboots to other bank
- **From boot (safety fallback):** Hold BACK + DOWN during power-up to rollback to the other bank

For other community firmwares, follow their instructions for switching banks.

### Updating One Firmware

The SD card update always writes to the **inactive** bank. To update a specific firmware:

1. **Switch to the firmware you are NOT updating** (the one you want to keep)
2. SD card update with the new .bin file
3. It writes to the inactive bank and reboots into the updated firmware

Example: To update SiN360 while keeping OtherFW:
1. Switch to OtherFW (Settings > Switch Bank)
2. SD card update with new SiN360 .bin
3. Device reboots into updated SiN360 on the other bank

### Fixing Broken CRC Files

If another developer's firmware .bin has CRC issues (fails SD card update), you can fix it:

```
# Strip the bad CRC (last 4 bytes) and re-append correct CRC
head -c -4 broken_firmware_wCRC.bin > firmware_raw.bin
python3 append_crc.py firmware_raw.bin firmware_fixed.bin
```

Or if you have the raw .bin without any CRC:

```
python3 append_crc.py firmware_raw.bin firmware_fixed.bin
```

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1** (in progress): NFC Tools, Settings menus, Bluetooth config
- **Phase 2**: WiFi attack suite via ESP32-C6 (deauth, beacon spam, evil portal, packet monitor)
- **Phase 3**: BadUSB HID keyboard with DuckyScript interpreter
- **Phase 4**: BadUSB over BLE
- **Phase 5**: Favorites, logging, file manager, OTA updates, Lua scripting engine

## Hardware

- **MCU**: STM32H573VIT6 (Cortex-M33, 2MB Flash, 640KB RAM)
- **Sub-GHz**: Si446x radio (300-915 MHz)
- **NFC**: ST25R3916 (13.56 MHz)
- **LF RFID**: 125 kHz read/write/emulate (EM4100, H10301, T5577)
- **IR**: IRMP/IRSND library (NEC, Samsung32, RC5, SIRCS, Kaseikyo + more)
- **Wireless**: ESP32-C6 co-processor (WiFi + BLE)
- **Display**: ST7586s ERC240160 (128x64)
- **USB**: CDC + MSC composite device
- **Hardware revision**: 2.x

See HARDWARE.md for pin mapping and schematic details.

## Building

### Prerequisites

- ARM GCC toolchain (arm-none-eabi-gcc 14.2+)
- CMake 3.22+
- Ninja build system
- Python 3 (for CRC generation)

### Linux (command line)

```
make
```

Output: ./artifacts/M1_SiN360_v0.9.0.1.bin (SD card update file with CRC)

### VS Code

1. Install extensions: CMake Tools, Cortex-Debug
2. Configure the project (select gcc-14_2_build-release)
3. Build via the Build icon

Output: ./out/build/gcc-14_2_build-release/M1_SiN360_v0.9.0.1_SD.bin

### STM32CubeIDE

Open the project and build in the IDE.

## Flashing

### Via ST-Link (development)

Connect ST-Link V2 to the M1 GPIO header:
- Pin 10 (PA14) -> SWCLK
- Pin 11 (PA13) -> SWDIO
- Pin 8 or 18 (GND) -> GND

```
st-flash write M1_SiN360_v0.9.0.1.bin 0x08000000
```

### Via SD Card (recommended for users)

1. Copy M1_SiN360_v0.9.0.1.bin to your M1's SD card
2. On the M1: Settings > Firmware Update
3. Browse to the file and select it
4. Wait for "UPDATE COMPLETED" and reboot

Works from original Monstatek firmware or any previous SiN360 version.
